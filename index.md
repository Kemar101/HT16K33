Today is the PCB soldered milestone allot have changed. I was planning to use the [16x8 HT16K33](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1427) with [4-channel I2C-safe Bi-directional Logic Level Converter ](https://www.adafruit.com/product/757) to create a really cool multidirection display. I can to realize that it was talking up too much time getting it to work. So I desided to use [Keyestudio 8x8 Dot Matrix Module ](http://www.keyestudio.com/ks0336.html).
# Current Progress:
I am currently on track. Todays class i was able to get the pcb bored solderer to my header and set up on my pie

# Problems/opportunities:
A potential problem that I would have at this time, would be the time it would take to do my fritzing diagram since i have multiple devices. I would need to finish it ASAP to continue being on track with my project.
# Financial update:
There was an additional purchase of a bidirection level shifter
