If continue with my current progress I will be meeting the objective that was defined in my proposal
#Problems/opportunities:
A potential problem that I would have at this time, would be the time it would take to do my fritzing diagram since i have multiple devices. I would need to finish it ASAP to continue being on track with my project.
